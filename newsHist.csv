11/16/05:`There are a few minor things to report:||First off, we're now a part of ADV's Anime ADVocate program. This primarily means that we get a trailer DVD each month with some of their newer acquisitions. It also hopefully means that we can get permission from them more quickly when we want to use their DVDs in showing.||Secondly, Tofu records will be sending us a Music Video DVD along with some surveys. As soon as we receive their package, we'll be taking some time during one of the meetings to show it.||Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we were recently contacted by a former president of the <a href="http://s6.invisionfree.com/Minot_Anime_Club/">Minot Anime Club</a>. So go give them a visit. Because we all know that the best way to renew contact with other clubs in the area is by raiding their message boards.
9/17/05:`At the meeting this coming week we will be having officer elections for the school year. Nominations were started at the meeting last Wednesday, and will be accepted until just before the elections start. If you would like to nominate someone before the meeting, either talk to an officer or email us.And be aware that you must be present at the meeting to confirm the nomination if you weren't nominated at the last meeting.||We will also have membership signup and dues for the fall semester at this meeting. Dues are $5 and help us to purchase a broader variety of things to show.And please note that Only paid student members are allowed to take part in the election of officers and other official club business.||Lastly, the showings for this week have been added to the showings page, with links to brief descriptions of the shows.|
