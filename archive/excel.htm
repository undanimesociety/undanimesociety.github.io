  <p><font size="4">The Messed-Up Happenings of the show that is, Excel Saga</font></p>
  <p align="left"> Compiled in this webpage is a listing of odd sightings and 
    things parodied from the animated program, Excel Saga. All of these findings 
    are provided from AnimeonDVD forum members who are listed at the bottom.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Spoiler Warning</b> - Any spoilers to other series on this 
    page will be typed as the same color as the background, so nobody accidently 
    (and unwantingly) reads a spoiler. Please highlight the text to see what it 
    says. While there shouldn't be really any spoilers in this page for other 
    shows, I would like to point out that the first caption for episode three 
    does contain somewhat of an allusion to Cowboy Bebop, which could be considered 
    a spoiler to those who haven't finished the series. </p>
  <p align="left"><b><i>Characters</i></b></p>
  <p align="left">Excel, Hyatt, and Il Palazzo are all named after hotels.</p>
  <p align="left">Nabeshin (who is based off of series director, Watanabe Shinichi) 
    is a parody of Lupin (note the similar dress), and maybe other similar characters 
    (like Spike from Cowboy Bebop, which could be why Nabeshin's hair is big). 
    See this website <a href="http://http://www.anime.or.jp/99/forum/forum_e3.html">here 
    </a>, to see how the real life director dress like Nabeshin. </p>
  <p align="left">Il Palazzo's costume is to that similar of Magic Knights Rayearth's, 
    Zagato. </p>
  <p align="left"><b><i>The Whole Series</i></b></p>
  <p align="left">The whole thing with part-time jobs is a parody of the anime 
    character who goes from job to job (Kintaro Oe from Goldenboy or Touya Kinomoto 
    from Card Captor Sakura), or holds multiple jobs at a time. &quot;Many an 
    anime staple is the character with the PT job, and just how the heck a person 
    can survive, much less eat on such a lifestyle.&quot; (Sorry k_chan, couldn't 
    think of a way to rephrase that ^^;;)</p>
  <p align="left">The name of the show, &quot;Quack Experimental Anime Excel Saga&quot; 
    is a spoof on other anime program names such as &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; 
    and &quot;Shin Seiki Evangelion&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"><b><i>Opening/Ending Sequences</i></b></p>
  <p align="left">In the opening credits, when Excel and Hyatt are singing on 
    the side walk, the cross walk sign on the left has a dancing figure on it.</p>
  <p align="left">During the ending, when the song ends and curtain closes, a 
    hand comes out and grabs Menchi.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><i>Episode 1</i></b></p>
  <p align="left">When Excel shows her, ahem, devotion, for Il Palazzo, by vomiting 
    and stripping her skin, there is a brief cut where Nazi swastikas are shown 
    in Excel's eyes. Probably in part in that she usually greets Il Palazzo with 
    a &quot;Heil Il Palazzo!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">When Excel first goes to kill Rikudo, when listening to the 
    Japanese track, Excel in English says, &quot;It's Showtime&quot;, much like 
    Saint Tail does before she transforms. This quote is also mentioned in Plastic 
    Little, also. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Bad Excel is a parody of either the original 70's Devilman 
    or the more recent Devilman Lady, with the bat-wings and green skin. </p>
  <p align="left">Pedro and Excel lunging at each other with a fist outstretched 
    is a parody of the classic boxing anime Ashita No Joe.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">During Nabeshin's introduction, a slightly modified version 
    of the theme from Trigun is playing.</p>
  <p align="left">According to the &quot;How to Excel&quot; handbook, released 
    with the Italian release, it is indicated that in Rikudo's apartment, there 
    should be a Dirty Pair model, an Evangelion unit, Rumiko Takahashi characters, 
    a &quot;Leepin III&quot; (Lupin III) poster, a &quot;Creamy Mama&quot; (Creamy 
    Mami) poster, and a Lum poster. </p>
  <p align="left">Excel dying in the first minute of the show pokes fun at a number 
    of shows that have done this, such as, Yuu Yuu Hakusho, Minky Momo (which 
    is what ADV's vid-notes list this as a reference to), 3x3 Eyes, and Hime-chan 
    no Ribbon. </p>
  <p align="left">The character on Rikudo's forehead is a spoof of the &quot;Wu&quot; 
    mark from the protagonist of 3x3 Eyes.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><i>Episode 2</i></b></p>
  <p align="left">The Puchuu's are somewhat a spoof of Pokemon creatures, in the 
    sense that they are little cute animals that can only say there name. Well, 
    until they are killed, anyway.</p>
  <p align="left">Nabeshin swimming up the waterfall in Il Palazzo's flooded chambers 
    is a direct sample from the Lupin III film, &quot;Castle of Cagliostro&quot;.</p>
  <p align="left">XStylus says it best, &quot;When Excel is being interrogated 
    by military soldiers at the end of Ep.2, the question "What is yer' purpose?" 
    asked, and Excel answers "A giant fish?". This made no sense to me until I 
    thought about it really hard. I then realized that it was an English pun. 
    In the soldier's slurred Japanglish, it sounded a bit like "What is a porpose?" 
    and anyone familiar with oceanology knows that a porpose is a sea mammal (and 
    if you call it a fish someone would promptly correct you that it is NOT a 
    fish).&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"><b><i>Episode 3</i></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">After the death of Tetsuko, she whispers 
    something to Nabeshin, which is similar to a scene from Cowboy Bebop.</font></p>
  <p align="left">On the back of the video cassette in the intro and at the end 
    when Rikudo is sleeping, you can see a future Excel Saga character. Also, 
    when Rikudo is sleeping there is a Ropponmatsu figure, another future character. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">When Tetsuko is, well, ripped in half, to say the least, the 
    whole art style changes to one similar of the popular Leiji Matsumoto. Tetsuko 
    (the female) also has a striking resemblance to any Matsumoto female character. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Another scene had Nabeshin and Tetsuko doing what can only be 
    called the "Big Fire Run" from Giant Robo.</p>
  <p align="left">More on the Matsumoto thing, Elora said it best through this, 
    &quot;In "Queen Millennia", there is the masked "Head of the Millennial Theives", 
    who is a main antagonist for roughly the first 30 episodes. However, it is 
    later revealed that the mysterious masked "man" (the voice is unquestionably 
    male) is really a woman who is using a voice-changing device. That person 
    is Yayoi's sister, Selene. And yes, Selene is a Matsumoto blonde (although 
    she's a darker blonde). The clincher is that "Iron Mask"'s mask has the same 
    look as the "Head of the Millennial Theives".. minus the palm tree, of course.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p align="left"><b><i>Episode 4</i></b></p>
  <p align="left">This episode features the introduction of Kumi Kumi, who will 
    chase Nabeshin throughout the rest of the series and will be a character in 
    Puni Puni Poemi.</p>
  <p align="left">Title of episode and dating sim, &quot;Love Puny&quot;, is based 
    off the popular show and game, &quot;Love Hina&quot;. Also of note, the name 
    of the Excel Saga spin off is &quot;Puni Puni Poemi&quot; (&quot;Puni&quot; 
    written with the same syllables in the name of the show and spoofed dating 
    sim&quot;) </p>
  <p align="left">The meeting under the tree is seen in countless other anime 
    shows such as, Kimagure Orange Road and Fushigi Yuugi.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><i>Episode 5</i></b></p>
  <p align="left">The little bottle that Hyatt passes around to the employees 
    (which Watanabe almost drink) is a yogurt drink that is popular in East Asian 
    countries. Usually, they are yellow in color and when they turn green, like 
    they were when Hyatt was passing them out, you are not supposed to drink them. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">The spreadsheet program that Excel stumbles upon is Microsoft's 
    Excel. </p>
  <p align="left">The Excel Girls (the two girls who come to Across looking to 
    join the band) are parodies of the two girls that provide the vocals for Excel 
    and Hyatt in the opening sequence. Also featured is the second song by the 
    Excel Girls (Excel Kobayashi and Hyatt Mikako, who make their debut here). 
    The song was played in the newspaper office. Excel <b>Kobayashi</b> is voiced 
    by Yumiko <b>Kobayashi</b> and <b>Mikako</b> Hyatt is voiced by <b>Mikako 
    </b>Takahashi (Both girls also voice the main roles in Puni Puni Poemi, Kobayashi 
    voicing Puni Puni.)</p>
  <p align="left">In the mayor's office, there are some similarites to be drawn, 
    as the mayor sits with his hands folded in front of his face with Kabapu standing 
    and staring out of the window as teh red sunset shines over the city. A similar 
    kind of scene from Evangelion with Gendo sitting and Fuyutsuki staring out 
    the window.</p>
  <p align="left">A reference to &quot;Princess Nine&quot; (possibly, was Princess 
    Nine out before Excel Saga?) is made when Excel pitches the baseball to Il 
    Palazzo (which spins in the glove, just like in Princess Nine), and is caught 
    perfectly, like when Mao was finally able to catch Ryo's pitches.</p>
  <p align="left">The Great Will of the Macrocosm cries &quot;Love and Peace&quot; 
    in reference to that of Trigun.</p>
  <p align="left">The lockers in city hall don't seem to be in any particular 
    order.</p>
  <p align="left">During the preview for the next episode, Hyatt is seen holding 
    and aiming a gun similar to Vash the Stampede. Note the &quot;.45 Long Colt&quot; 
    inscription. </p>
