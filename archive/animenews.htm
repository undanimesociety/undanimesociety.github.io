      <p><b>Site Update</b></p>
      <p>Due to unforseen circumstances, the site is being put on temporary hiatus 
        for another week. Sorry for any inconvience to those that do read the 
        site. How about a plug to tide you over? Buy GTO!</p>

      <p><b>ADV's Perfect Collection Flawed!</b></p>
      <p>ADV has added a new title to its reduced-price Perfect Collection line, 
        now making the line no longer &quot;Perfect.&quot; Martian Successor Nadesico 
        and all of its six-disc glory is to be released September 24, 2002 at 
        $89.98. </p>

      <p><b>Remember that show.. uhh.. FLCL?</b></p>
      <p>Yes, remember that show FLCL? Delayed. June 25, 2002 is the new date, 
        probably because of the extras they have been working on for a long time 
        now. I'd rather have a good release than a horrible one myself, but Christ, 
        it's first release date was in January. </p>

      <b>Sailor Yen Power! Make Up!</b> 
      <p>According to the good folks at <a href="http://ww.anime-daisuki.com">Anime 
        Daisuki</a>, a sixth season of Sailor Moon is in the works. While not 
        confirmed, it is rumored to believe this will not only please die-hard 
        fans, but the people behind the production and whatnot of the series because 
        as we learned a while back, Sailor Moon equals money.</p>

      <p>Synch-Point - 1<br>
        Well, the new targeted date is 6 months after its first date. I know they 
        have been getting held up because of the commentary track, but it's been 
        done for some time and whatnot. Oh well, its only one point, S-P. Manga 
        will probably beat the bejeezus out of that.</p>
